# BlackJack
C++ implementation of the game BlackJack

## Simplified rules

The goal of blackjack is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, and to have a higher hand than the dealer. If either the player or dealer goes over 21, they bust and lose the game.

Values of cards

Face cards is worth 10 points
Number cards is worth the same as the number on the card.

Players options (h = hit, s = stand, q = quit)

Player plays until they choose to stand, afterwards it's the dealers turn.
